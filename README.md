Just testing the capabilities of the PS4 web browser


*Edit:* After a little investigation, it seems that even though the PS4 browser supports the audio tag, it doesn't seem to support any popular codecs (MP3, AAC, WAV). I've managed to get an audio element to appear on the page however. I will need to do some further experimentation to determine how audio can be played through the PS4 browser.
